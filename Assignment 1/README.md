# Result-Processing
I have write a java program to process the results of an examination. There are three categories of files:      
Student information    
Subject and paper information    
Marks obtained  
Each student gives exams for three subjects—Math, Physics and Chemistry. Math has one paper, while Physics and Chemistry have two papers each. In each paper, there are two parts—theoretical and practical. I have tabulate the marks and produce student wise results.

# Rules for Passing
The student has to get at at least 50% of the total marks of a portion to pass in that portion (theoretical or practical)

    The student has to pass in both portions to pass the subject
    If the subject has papers, the student has to pass in both papers
    The student has to pass in all 3 subjects to get a pass in the full exam
 
 # File Formats

All input files are CSV files, but the field separator is a ":" (colon), instead of comma.
